Welcome to my personal homepage!  

My ongoing projects (since Sep, 2023) focus on:
- **Outlier Exposure (OE) Training-based Out-of-Distribution Detection**: developing learning frameworks to tackle the problems in current OE training, especially for the outlier synthesis-based methods.
- **Out-of-Distribution Detection Theory**: developing analytical framework for guaranteeing OOD Detection.
- **Anomaly Segmentation on the Road**: appying OOD detection methods to segment anomalies on the road.
